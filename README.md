# OpenGLPong

I'm a noob at graphics and I'm slow at this. ðŸ˜Ÿ


Basic 2 player pong game using [modern OpenGL](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Modern_OpenGL_Introduction), [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/)  and [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/).

## Movement
Player 1 **W** and **S**.

Player 2 **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW**.

## TODO
- [x] create paddles.
- [x] transform paddles individually using input.
- [x] restrict paddle movement from the screen.
- [ ] create a ball.
- [ ] make the ball move randomly.
- [ ] detect collisions.
- [ ] separate shader into a class.
- [ ] vertex buffer, vertex array, and element buffer abstration.
- [ ] create quads (players and the ball) by using a class (idk how).
- [ ] if I get here, maybe create a menu.
